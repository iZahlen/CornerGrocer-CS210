# CornerGrocer
Third project for my SNHU programming class CS210. 

### Prompt
You are doing a fantastic job at Chada Tech in your new role as a junior developer, and you exceeded expectations in your last assignment for Airgead Banking. Since your team is impressed with your work, they have given you another, more complex assignment. Some of the code for this project has already been completed by a senior developer on your team. Because this work will require you to use both C++ and Python, the senior developer has given you the code to begin linking between C++ and Python. Your task is to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, which should incorporate all of their requested functionality.

The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers. The program that the Corner Grocer is asking you to create should address the following three requirements for a given text-based input file that contains a list of purchased items for a single day:

    Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
    Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
    Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

As you complete this work, your manager at Chada Tech is interested to see your thought process regarding how you use the different programming languages, C++ and Python. To help explain your rationale, you will also complete a written explanation of your codeâ€™s design and functionality.
