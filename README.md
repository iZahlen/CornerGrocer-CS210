# CornerGrocer
Third project for my SNHU programming class CS210. 

### Prompt
You are doing a fantastic job at Chada Tech in your new role as a junior developer, and you exceeded expectations in your last assignment for Airgead Banking. Since your team is impressed with your work, they have given you another, more complex assignment. Some of the code for this project has already been completed by a senior developer on your team. Because this work will require you to use both C++ and Python, the senior developer has given you the code to begin linking between C++ and Python. Your task is to build an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer, which should incorporate all of their requested functionality.

The Corner Grocer needs a program that analyzes the text records they generate throughout the day. These records list items purchased in chronological order from the time the store opens to the time it closes. They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers. The program that the Corner Grocer is asking you to create should address the following three requirements for a given text-based input file that contains a list of purchased items for a single day:

    Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
    Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
    Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

As you complete this work, your manager at Chada Tech is interested to see your thought process regarding how you use the different programming languages, C++ and Python. To help explain your rationale, you will also complete a written explanation of your codeâ€™s design and functionality.

### Reflection

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
the goal of the project was to essentially, create a program that would analyze text records generated throughout the day to keep track of transactions of items sold at the Corner Grocer store, and then be able to display said information in three seperate ways. 

    What did you do particularly well?
I feel as though most of my code was more or less successful. I ran into minor snags here and there but I believe I managed to get everything up and running. I'm particualrly fond of my error checking. 

    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Definitely could have benefitting for using more in-depths Python modules and what not. As this was my first time really utilizing Python since my first coding class, I tended to be more reserved. 

    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I struggled a ton with input validation. Coming from Python, or even Java... I feel like validating input in either of those is much less simple (or maybe I just have more experience there. Particularly, I would have loved if I managed to find a more simple function to ignore input cases (upper and lower). I think in the end I just didn't validate that form of input and the input are all case sensitive in my program. 

    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Definitely the ability to utilize Python along side other languages. It was super interesting the way it was done and I hope I get to do so more frquently going forward. 

    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried my best to explain whether that be through comments or generally readable code. Each of my functions are properly commented and explain what they do and their parameters. Approrpiate white space and general formatting.
